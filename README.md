## 📂 Project Structure
- `Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full workflow  
- `rainfall in india 1901-2015.csv` → Dataset used  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of historical rainfall data  
- Handling missing values and duplicates  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Machine learning model training and evaluation for rainfall prediction  
- Final model built using an **Ensemble approach**, followed by accuracy comparison with other models  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains historical rainfall data for different subdivisions of India from **1901 to 2015**.  

## 🔮 Results
- Prediction of rainfall based on historical patterns  
- Accuracy comparison between different models  
- Ensemble model gave the best results among all tested approaches
